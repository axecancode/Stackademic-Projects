                Whether we’re creating a revolutionary brand to redefine an entire category or aiding an existing brand in entering a new market, we help brands <bold>position</bold> themselves.
                Oh for heaven's sake. We're talking about <em>marketing</em> positions, obviously. Stop giggling like an 8th-grader.
                Unless you <em>are</em> an 8th-grader, in which case: giggle away. Life will indubitably slap you in the face once you hit adulthood, so laugh it up while you can.

                We've been in the business since before you were born. 
                <br/>
                Most likely anyway, since everyone on our team is an octogenarian. 
                Some might even be nonagenarians, but we're not sure, because asking people their age these days might be construed as ageist. 
                Anyway, our point is this: with over 30 people in our team, we have over 1,950 years of collective experience. 
                Beat that, other wannabe agencies!
                Also, as you might have noticed, our copy is so damn good that you feel compelled to read all of it, regardless of how you might feel afterwards.
                And <em>that's</em> our real strength. In today's attention-deficit world, <em>any</em> attention is <strong>good</strong> attention.
