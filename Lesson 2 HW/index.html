                Hello World! 
                <br/>
                <p>My name is Akshay, although close friends call me "Axe".
                Some say this moniker sounds murderous. Since I'm an introvert, I find this to be a desirable trait for a nickname to have.
                My (current) full-time job is that of a portrait photographer, and I'm based in Mumbai, India. 
                I've been a photographer for the last 15 years, and a tech enthusiast for most of my life. 
                Half a lifetime ago, I used to have a web design/dev business and a computer hardware business. 
                While I've moved on professionally, I still build my own PCs and generally keep abreast of the tech industry.
